	 *
	 * Two ways an asset fails to render, both landing on the same fallback:
	 *
	 * - The format is undecodable everywhere (HEIC — see `browserCanDecodeImage`).
	 *   Known up front, so no request is made and there is no flash of a broken
	 *   icon while it fails.
	 * - The load fails for any other reason — the object is gone, a signed URL has
	 *   expired, the file is truncated. Only `onerror` can tell us that.
	 *
	 * The same reasoning the grid already applies to posterless videos, which the
	 * note by `backfillPosters` puts as a grid of broken <img> being worse than
	 * no image at all.
