/**
 * Maintains the asset-reference index — which documents use which assets.
 *
 * The sibling of {@link ReferencesService}, which does the same for
 * document-to-document references, and deliberately the same shape: the
 * collection API calls in after a save, the walk is replayed, and the rows for
 * that document are replaced atomically.
 *
 * It exists because "where is this asset used?" was answered by
 * `WHERE published_data::text LIKE '%<assetId>%'` — a full scan casting every
 * document's JSON to text, which no index can serve. Tolerable for one asset,
 * impossible as a filter: "show me unused assets" became assets × documents.
 *
 * **Written inside the document's own write transaction, and failures throw.**
 *
 * This was best-effort post-commit at first, on the reasoning that a stale index
 * costs a wrong badge while the delete guard — which reads the documents
 * themselves — keeps the destructive path safe. The guard part held. The rest
 * did not: the "Unused" filter *is* the index, so a missed row doesn't produce a
 * cosmetic blemish, it invites an editor to delete an asset that is in use. The
 * only thing standing behind them at that point is the guard, and a feature
 * whose correctness depends on a later safety net catching it is not correct.
 *
 * So the index is now maintained the way `appendEvent` maintains the outbox: in
 * the same transaction as the change that caused it, such that a document cannot
 * be saved without its references being recorded. The cost is real and worth
 * naming — a bug in the walk now fails the editor's save rather than being
 * swallowed — which is why {@link collectAssetReferences} is pure, separately
 * tested, and skips malformed references instead of throwing.
 *
 * The delete guard still reads documents rather than this index. Defence in
 * depth is cheap here, and it is what caught the drift this design replaced.
