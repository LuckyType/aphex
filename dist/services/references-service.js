 * its schema; we walk the data via the schema-aware walker, dedupe the
 * resulting ref IDs, and atomically replace the rows for that referencer.
 *
 * **Written inside the document's own write transaction, and failures throw.**
 *
 * Previously logged-and-swallowed, on the grounds that a stale index shouldn't
 * block a save. The trouble is what reads it: the publish and unpublish guards.
 * An under-populated index there doesn't show a wrong badge, it lets a
 * still-referenced document be unpublished — the index says nothing points at
 * it, so nothing stops you. A guard that silently weakens when a write failed is
 * worse than no guard, because it is trusted.
 *
 * Same contract as the sibling {@link AssetReferencesService}, for the same
 * reason, and see its note for the tradeoff being accepted.
