// ai/content-workspace-tools.ts
//
// The two `execution: 'workspace'` tools: `content_patch_fields` (buffer a shallow-merge
// patch onto the document currently open in an editor tab) and `content_save_draft`
// (flush the buffered patch(es) as one CAS-guarded save). Live outside `mcp/tools.ts` on
// purpose — these aren't MCP-servable (an MCP client has no browser tab holding a live
// draft), so they only ever reach a caller through `resolveAgentTools`'s `documentContext`
// gate (`mcp/tools.ts`).
//
// `execute` on both is unreachable in practice: `run-agent-turn.ts`'s per-round tool loop
// partitions calls by `definition.execution` and never calls `.execute` for a `'workspace'`
// tool — it pauses the turn instead (see `types/agent-stream.ts`'s `done` event doc) and the
// *client* resolves the call against a live `DocumentWorkspace`. These bodies exist only to
// satisfy `ContentAgentTool`'s shape; don't "clean them up" into something callable without
// also removing the pause branch in `run-agent-turn.ts`, or a workspace tool would silently
// execute server-side against no live draft at all.
