// Adapter health, for the probe an orchestrator points at.
//
// Deliberately returns a plain result rather than a `Response`: the app owns the
// HTTP shape (status code, headers, whatever else it wants to report), and this
// owns the question of what "healthy" means. That also keeps it usable outside a
// request — a worker loop or a CLI can ask the same question.
//
// The three decisions worth not re-deriving per app:
//
//   1. A check that *throws* is unhealthy, not a 500. Adapters reject on a dead
//      socket or expired bucket credentials, and a probe that propagates the
//      rejection reports "the app is broken" when the truthful answer is "a
//      dependency is down". Every check is settled, never awaited bare.
//   2. A check that *hangs* is unhealthy too, and this is the one hand-written
//      probes miss. `isHealthy()` on a wedged connection can hang indefinitely;
//      without a bound the probe hangs with it and the platform learns nothing
//      until its own timeout fires. Each check races a timer.
//   3. The result stays coarse. Whatever an app returns from here is public and
//      unauthenticated — booleans, no driver strings, no connection URLs.
/** Default bound on each individual check. Comfortably inside a typical 10s probe timeout. */
