// A small fixed-window rate limiter for the unauthenticated endpoints cms-core exposes.
//
// Why this exists at all: the auth provider rate-limits its *own* HTTP endpoints, but the
// CMS facades (`POST /api/user/request-password-reset`, `/reset-password`) call the provider
// server-side. Better Auth's limiter — like its other request-shaped guards — only engages
// for calls that arrived over HTTP with a `ctx.request`, so an in-process call sails past it.
// The facades were therefore completely unthrottled: an email-sending endpoint and a
// token-checking endpoint, both reachable by anyone.
//
// Scope, stated plainly: this is per-process memory. Behind N app instances the effective
// limit is N× what's configured, and a restart forgets every window. That is a real
// weakening, and a deployment that needs a hard guarantee should put a limiter in front of
// the app or back this with the shared cache. It is still worth having — it turns "unlimited"
// into "bounded per instance", which is the difference between an email bomb and a nuisance.
