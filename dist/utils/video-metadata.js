 *
 * Done here rather than on the server because the alternative is ffmpeg: a large
 * native dependency, awkward on serverless, and a build-time burden for every
 * self-hoster who never uploads a video. The browser already has a demuxer and a
 * decoder for exactly the formats it can play, and at upload time the file is
 * local — no download, no storage round-trip.
 *
 * What it cannot do is the honest tradeoff: a codec this browser can't decode
 * (or a server-side/API upload, which never runs this) yields nothing. Every
 * field is therefore optional, and callers must render a video with no poster
 * and no duration rather than treating absence as an error.
