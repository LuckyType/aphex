// visitor, a download link with a deadline — while the bucket itself stays
// closed and its layout stays invisible.
//
// This is deliberately not `config.signedDownloads`, which redirects to a
// signed URL on the *bucket*. That works, but it hands the viewer a
// `r2.cloudflarestorage.com` URL, exposes the storage key layout, and moves the
// asset outside every check this route performs — including range handling and
// derivative selection. Signing our own URL keeps all of it here.
