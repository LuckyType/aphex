// Deciding whether an asset is private.
//
// An asset does not store "private". It stores a *pointer* to the field it was
// uploaded into — `metadata.schemaType` and `metadata.fieldPath` — and the
// answer is recomputed from the live schema on every request. That is what makes
// flipping `private: true` in code take effect immediately, with no migration.
//
// It also means the answer can stop being computable. Rename or delete that
// field and the pointer dangles: the lookup returns nothing, and "we don't know"
// used to be treated as "public" — so renaming a private field silently
// published every asset behind it. Hence the second half of this file: a
// resolved value is also stamped onto the asset at upload, and used as the
// fallback when the live lookup fails.
/** Field types that hold an asset reference and therefore support `private`. */

 * is exactly the rename/delete case that used to fail open.
 *
 * An asset with neither — uploaded through the media library before this
 * existed, or through the API with no field context — is public, as it always
 * was. Treating "no information at all" as private would turn every existing
