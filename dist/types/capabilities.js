// Capability-based access control.
//
// Roles are per-organization rows in `cms_roles`, each mapping a role name to
// a set of capability strings. Four built-in roles are seeded for every org
// (owner/admin/editor/viewer); additional custom roles are purely additive.
//
// Authorization checks consult an auth-scoped capability set that is resolved
// once per request (see RolesService + handleAuthHook) so `hasCapability` is
// a synchronous set-membership check in request handlers and UI code.
// Note: organization deletion is NOT a delegable capability — it's an
// ownership-only action, enforced by a hardcoded `membership.role === 'owner'`
// check in the DELETE /organizations/[id] handler. No `org.delete` cap exists
// so it can't be granted to custom roles or picked in the role editor.
