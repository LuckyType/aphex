 * - `workspace`: must round-trip to a live editor tab holding the in-progress
 *   draft (e.g. "apply this change to what's currently open, unsaved, in the
 *   browser"). `run-agent-turn.ts` never calls `execute` for a tool declared
 *   this way — it pauses the turn instead (`AgentStreamEvent`'s
 *   `awaiting_workspace_tool` finish reason) and the caller resolves it
 *   client-side against a `DocumentWorkspace` (types/document-workspace.ts),
 *   then resumes. Only advertised at all when `resolveAgentTools` is given a
 *   `documentContext` (mcp/tools.ts) — see `ai/content-workspace-tools.ts` for
 *   the two tools that currently use this mode.
