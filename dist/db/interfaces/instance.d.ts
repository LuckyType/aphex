     *
     * Exists because "is the instance empty?" and "insert the first profile" were
     * two statements with a gap between them: two sign-ups arriving together could
     * both observe an empty instance and both be promoted to super admin. Every
     * bootstrap policy gates on `isFirstUser`, so at most one promotion is
     * intended in all of them — this makes that atomic rather than likely.
     *
     * Implemented as an insert of a dedicated row that conflicts with itself, so
     * the database decides the winner in a single statement. That matters more
     * than it sounds: the obvious fix — wrapping the check and the insert in one
     * transaction — holds SQLite's single write lock across the auth provider's
     * own concurrent user and session inserts and fails sign-up with SQLITE_BUSY.
     *
     * Optional: an adapter that doesn't implement it keeps the old non-atomic
     * behaviour (with a warning) rather than refusing to ever promote anyone,
     * which would leave a fresh install with no way to get its first administrator.
