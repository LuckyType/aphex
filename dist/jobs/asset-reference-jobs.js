// entire walk before their page rendered.

 * Bump when indexing semantics change and every org needs one more rebuild.
 *
 * **Anything that changes what `collectAssetReferences` finds is such a change**
 * — a new wrapper shape, a fixed gap, a corrected field path. Forgetting is
 * quiet and confusing: the job already completed under the old key, so the fix
 * ships, nothing re-runs, and the index stays wrong in exactly the way that was
 * just fixed. v3 is the rich-text image shape, which v2 ran without.
 *
 * The idempotency key is the marker for "this org has been backfilled" — a
 * completed job row, which `scheduleJob` returns instead of inserting a
 * duplicate. That makes enqueueing free to attempt on every request and correct
 * to attempt only once, without a flag anywhere that a normal write could set by
 * accident. The previous design inferred it from "does the index have any rows",
 * which the incremental path also satisfies, so the rebuild it was gating never
 * ran a second time and never could.
