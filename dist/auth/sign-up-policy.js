// Supabase, or something hand-rolled — so they live behind the `AuthProvider`
// port rather than inside any one implementation of it.
//
// Before this existed, both rules were enforced inside `@aphexcms/auth`'s
// Better Auth wiring, which meant a third-party provider silently inherited
// neither: `inviteOnly: true` would be configured and quietly do nothing. An
// implementation is free to call these wherever its lifecycle allows, but it is
// no longer free to *re-derive* them.
