// It also has one non-obvious rule that every caller has to get right, which is
// why it lives in one place instead of six: **proof of emptiness, never absence
// of proof.** `hasAnyUserProfiles` is optional on the adapter interface, and an
// adapter that cannot answer must NOT be read as "nobody is here yet". Getting
// that backwards is exactly how a missing implementation once promoted every
// single sign-up to super admin.
