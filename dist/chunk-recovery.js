// chunk-recovery.ts — standalone on purpose (importable as `@aphexcms/cms-core/chunk-recovery`
// via the package's `./*` wildcard export), NOT re-exported from `/client`: that barrel pulls in
// the admin UI component tree, and this is meant to run from a public-facing site's
// `hooks.client.ts` — the hottest of hot paths, loaded by every visitor. No npm dependencies;
// `installNavigationTimeoutRecovery` uses SvelteKit's own `$app/navigation` virtual module (not
// an installed package) and must be called from a `.svelte` component's `<script>`, not
// `hooks.client.ts` — see its doc comment.
//
// A route's lazily-loaded JS chunk (or the entry module itself) can fail to fetch from a
// transient CDN/proxy blip — a dropped connection between an edge network and the origin, or a
// stale cached HTML document referencing since-replaced hashed filenames.
//
// Three distinct gaps, three distinct hooks:
//  1. The *initial* hydration path (the entry module itself fails to load) throws/rejects in a
//     way the browser surfaces globally — `installChunkLoadRecovery()`'s `window` listeners below
//     catch this.
//  2. A client-side *navigation* (clicking a link to a lazily-loaded route) fails differently:
//     SvelteKit's own router catches the rejected dynamic import internally, routes it through
//     the app's `handleError` client hook, and resolves the navigation as failed — it never
//     becomes an `unhandledrejection` or a global `error` event, so case 1's listeners are
//     structurally blind to it. Confirmed live: a real "click Blog, nothing happens" report
//     produced exactly this — three `handleError`-logged "Failed to fetch dynamically imported
//     module" errors with no reload, since nothing was listening. `handleChunkLoadClientError`
//     is meant to be called from that hook (see `hooks.client.ts`'s `handleError` export).
//  3. Both (1) and (2) only fire once SvelteKit (or the browser) has already decided the load
//     failed — and on a real transient origin blip, that decision can ride on the CDN/proxy's own
//     gateway timeout, which is not fast (observed live: ~90s on an actual 522). A visitor
//     watching a click do nothing for a minute-plus before it silently self-heals has not had a
//     good experience, even though the page technically "recovered." `installNavigationTimeoutRecovery`
//     doesn't wait for that — it pre-empts it, forcing a hard navigation to the destination itself
//     after a short, generous timeout if SvelteKit's own client-side navigation hasn't finished by
//     then, rather than reacting to a failure that may take a minute to be reported as one.
