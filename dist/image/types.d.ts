/**
 * The shape `<Image>` consumes: an image field value after asset injection.
 *
 * Declared here rather than imported from the admin types so this entrypoint
 * stays free of anything server- or admin-shaped — it is imported by public
 * marketing pages, and a stray import is how a barrel drags the admin bundle
 * onto them. The dependency runs the other way instead: `types/asset.ts` builds
 * its `ImageAsset` on top of {@link InjectedAsset}, so the set of fields
 * injection produces is declared exactly once and a document's own type can't
 * disagree with what `<Image>` reads off it.
