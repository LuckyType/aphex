/**
 * Plugin type system — the public authoring surface.
 *
 * A plugin is a manifest of typed "parts", each implementing a named extension
 * point. The kinds are split into two planes (see PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PLAN.md §Constraint):
 *
 *  - SERVER / serializable plane — schemas, server routes, capabilities. Collected
 *    by the engine at boot; safe to reason about without loading any component.
 *  - COMPONENT plane — document actions, admin tools, field components. These carry
 *    Svelte components and are only ever imported into admin module code, never
 *    passed through SvelteKit `load` (load data must stay serializable).
 *
 * All imports here are type-only, so this module is safe on both planes.
